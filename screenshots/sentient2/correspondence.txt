sentient activity

...started about 30 minutes ago, ended about 10 minutes ago, Dark Crossroads sector. I engaged and killed something like a c8, 11, 7, 7, 9, some squids and a small jelly storm. Conflux whalesong sounded. I received the following messages:

screenshots attached.

Re: sentient activity?

Pilot Zuon -- thank you so much for this.  We've been hearing about sentient activity in Dark Crossroads, but yours is the first real detailed information we have received.  It will be invaluable.  I can't believe it actually "spoke" -- that is incredibly rare.  Hopefully we'll be able to decode this.

One thing you did not mention -- what type of sentient was there?  C8?  C9?

Best Regards,

decode word anagrams

the of is It Ascendancy Ka

possible decode of sentence anagram

the Ascendancy of Zethryn(?) Ka, It is coming

Someone better versed in Conflux lore might have a better suggestion than "Zethryn". Zethryn, Zythern, and Zythren at least seem to be possibilities.

Wow, that was fast.

Zethryn/Zythren are not familiar to me but will definitely research this.



Thank you again.

Re: sentient activity

I don't think any of the conflux I engaged were sentient. If I had to guess, I'd suggest the C8, but I doubt it. Pilot Sinver may have seen the sent. I think he mentioned, as you suggest, a C8 or C9, but I forget which. I have seen a sentient C9 on multiple occasions, but I didn't see it this time. Don't know if it's the same C9 or different one each time.
