-Added new bounty functions that gradually improve a bountied target's PR toward zero if downed and the bounty is collected.<br>
-Corrected a problem that had been preventing defense droid kill penalties and kill message displays probably since Episode2 or prior.<br>
-TRI now deducts a bounty from the bountied pilot's account to reimburse the faction when the bounty is collected.<br>
-Pilots with a bounty are no longer permitted to use /give. Pilots who kill a bountied squadmate are no longer awarded the bounty.  These changes were necessary to limit exploits.<br>
-Corrected an oversight that created the appearance that a pilot had no bounty with negative PR but only newbie equipment.<br>
-Added FuelScoop MODx to provide the equivalent of "puring" for resources not available in pure asteroids. Some other hard-to mine commods also included. Check JOSSH or the item description for info.<br>
-Fixed an issue with a GM command for POS that was caused by revisions to POS location handling code from the 1.0096 patch.<br>
-Corrected a problem that could arise when a player under the newbie Flight Registry receives a commission.<br>
-Slightly improved C0-C5 topspeeds in response to low-rank ship changes made in 1.0099 patch.<br>
-Fixed a GM command used for flux-related events.<br>
-Fixed a problem apparently existing since before Episode 2 that would have allowed the artifact in The Outer Edge to be unpoppable.<br>
-Added command /toggletips specifically so pilots assigned to the new pilot Flight Registry may turn the TIPS: channel off and on.<br>
-Preliminary spacelane clearing mechanisms are now in place. Some sectors, when cleared of flux, will stay cleared for ~10min.  This feature will be enhanced as more flux changes are added.</TD>

-Fixed a problem with interaction between the Trade and Linkup screens that could interrupt a trade and prevent it from being resumed.<br>
-Corrected an old issue in Simulator that resulted in pilots erroneously displaying a title.<br>

-Resolved the longstanding pure asteroid texture display problem, in which the pure would briefly switch to a standard asteroid texture.<br>
-Corrected a serious problem with asteroid replenishment affecting Pulsar sector and any recent asteroid edits dating since Ep2 release.<br>
-Changed the chat and message display code to perform line breaks at words instead of at a hard character limit.<br>
-Adjusted econ to provide activity-driven demand for Med Supplies, similar to mechanisms for Ammo, Armor, and foods created last summer.<br>
-Added a GM-only interface for the warfare data systems that are gradually being implemented on the server.<br>
-Altered pilot insurance to only be denied to pilots with negative PR in their home faction.<br>
-Increased the ranking payouts for Ranks 1-9, to begin addressing the lowbie cash deficiency.  Likewise altered and rebalanced the starting credits for new pilot accounts.<br>
-Lowered ship hull prices for the Rank 3 and Rank 6 ships.<br>
-Altered ship stats on several Rank 0, Rank 3, and Rank 6 ships, most particularly mass, drag, and engine types, to make these ships more friendly to new pilots. Speed especially was added to reduce new player boredom.<br>
-Performance was altered on several sz1 engines (Mitoria, Mitoria Plus, PCE-1) as balance considerations for the lowbie ship adjustments.<br>
-Adjusted gun hardpoints on the Intruder (Sol HF) for a tighter shot pattern.<br>
-Shepherd engine performance was increased and the little-used Travant Plus was converted from sz2 to sz3 and given new stats.  Anyone with Travant Plus engines mounted at time of patch should contact support.<br>
-Created a new Flight Registry restricted to non-reset pilots of Rank 0-8. These pilots are now marked with a shield icon in the HUD.<br>
-Kills of a player protected under the New Pilot Registry will NOT increment the killer's factional kill stats.  Obsessive statpadders are thus encouraged to ignore newbies.<br>
-Added new "TIPS" channel, like KTRI, which broadcasts a selection of hints and tips to lowbie pilots flagged with the new Flight Registry.<br>
-Reorganized mentor medal allocation to correct the system and remove clutter: "Cross of the Preceptor" now is a 10x indicator for "Cross of the Mentor".<br>
-Mentoring for a lowbie pilot now concludes at Rank 9 instead of Rank 10.  The small xp award for receiving the Cross of the Mentor medal has been increased.<br>
-Terminated jelly spawns in station sectors.  Jellies will enter the regular spawn rotation when spawn systems change in an upcoming patch.<br>
-Disabled combat mission availability for Rank 0 pilots, who do not spawn conflux.<br>
-Altered the repercussions for docking at a station where you possess negative PR.  Armor is no longer removed.  Ammo guns are not armed if you have severely negative PR (<= -60).<br>
-Added further restrictions on the use of /vouch.  /vouch is no longer available at Rank 49.  /vouch now requires spending xp, representing "factional clout".  It will NOT be possible to lose rank by using this tool.<br>
-Rewrote bounty calculations.  Bounty payments will tend to be more substantial than previously.  Pilot rank and the observer are no longer directly related to the observed bounty.  JOSSH will contain complete information.<br>
-Resolved problem where the observed bounty on a targetted pilot disagreed with the amount received if that pilot was downed.<br>
-Fixed major bug where a pilot displaying a temp bounty being downed caused the pilot who downed him to receive a permanent bounty and negative PR.<br>
-Added new functionality to allow Tag changes, due to kills or piracy for instance, to propagate in flight and be correctly visible to others without a pilot needing to dock first.<br>
-Adjustments to HUD in simulator: Tags now visible but still have no effect, pilots labelled "Sim", not "Ally", no bounties visible, bug causing incorrect Titles on all sim pilots (which apparently has existed since game release) eliminated.<br>
-Identified and fixed reported problem with flux spawn loop that was indeed preventing all spawns for pilots of rank below 10.</TD>

-Altered the ship explosion graphics so that the texture used is appropriate to the object exploding.<br>
-Adjusted food/water and ammo/armor/fuel portions of the consumption code.  Amounts consumed should both be lower and more accurately based on player activity.<br>
-Enabled toggling system for ECM use.  Antiradars may be toggled.  Antiflux and Whistle are "always on" until changes pending in conflux project patch can be completed.<br>
-Added new Jammer ECM device for use against missiles.  All ECM use defaults to the 'X' key. The Jammer drains power while active for 10 seconds and has a 90 second delay before re-use.<br>
-Converted the PWD100 MODx to an ECM type device.  Use of the PWD consumes a burst of power and some fuel (for the plasma), and has a 30 second recharge delay.<br>
-Adjusted ECM slots on selected combat ships in an effort to balance access to and usage of the new antimissile ECMs.<br>
-Added new Droptank device.  This is implemented as a missile.  When "fired", the tank empties its fuel load into the onboard tank and is jettisoned.<br>

-Altered Flashfire indicator on HUD to visibly show when a Flashfire is running, in addition to the existing auditory cues.<br>
-Changed the Nano Assemblers (and Hydroponics Units) so that a default load from use of the building is 10 units instead of 1 unit.  This is limited by cargo capacity available.<br>
-Replaced the cockpit graphic for the Solrain Intruder HF with a version that has a black rectangle behind the radar area.  All Oct cockpits are being examined for future changes.<br>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All stockpiles of items in the market are now subject to decay if the stockpiles are large enough.  If a station has over 500 units of one commodity or over 5000 units of a single type of equipment the stockpile will begin to decay. The rate of decay is <b>1%</b> of the stockpile per hour.<p> 
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When commodities are sold to a station, the station will now keep any commodities that it has a demand for and place them in backup inventory.  Items that are not in demand will be placed into the regular market and are immediately available for purchase.<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A station will have demand for a commodity if the station needs to produce anything made from that commodity and does not already have the needed commodities in backup inventory.
