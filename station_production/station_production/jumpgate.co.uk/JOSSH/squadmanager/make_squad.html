	<TD COLSPAN="2">Welcome, fellow Reconstructionist.  Your journey has taken you far across the five systems and you have survived much hardship and accomplished many great feats.  It is the goal of all worthy surface dwellers to become active members of TRI.  Of these noble individuals, only a few accomplish the lofty goal of being allowed to create their own specialized squad in The Initiative.  Beginning a squad is no small matter and not to be entered lightly, thus you may only found a squad upon achieving rank 26 or higher.  Being responsible for a squad gives you the awesome responsibility of the success, maintenance, even the very lives of others.  They will depend on you for guidance, leadership and support.  Remember that you are a representative of the well respected Initiative; through which the systems will prosper and extend to reaches never imagined.  Good luck!</TD>
