		<TD BGCOLOR='000000'><FONT COLOR='d2d2d2'>Greetings pilot. I am glad to see that you have taken the time to check out the TRI Privateers. The importance of strong squads should be obvious; there is strength in numbers. Together we are greater than the mere sum of our parts. We are always eager to accept new members and at this time, all we ask of applicants is that they leave their prejudices behind, particularly those of a factional nature.
<br><br> 

While the wisdom and expertise of seasoned pilots is greatly needed, fresh new pilots are always welcome.<br><br>

The TRI Privateers attempt to remain as politically neutral as possible, as unnecessary political ties can often hinder the acquisition of profit by inviting senseless hostilities. However, we support <b>T</b>he <b>R</b>econstruction <b>I</b>nitiative and as-such we seek to advance the reconstruction projects of all factions and intend to defend TRI "civilian" pilots against threats.<br><br>

<b>Founding</b><br>
The TRI Privateers were founded on 102.10.13 by three pilots: Bayonette, stalingrad, and FireFly_ who, growing tired of endless conflicts and skirmishes between factions, pilots, and squads, sought to band together an alliance of independent pilots more interested in personal gain and the betterment of all members of TRI rather than petty political and factional disputes.<br><br>

<b>Our Name:</b><br>
<b>"TRI"</b> refers to our desire to welcome members of all three space-faring factions as well as implying our desire to support T.R.I.`s attempts to reconstruct our civilization and bring about a better life to all mankind.<br><br>

<b>"Privateer"</b> is a reference to the armed merchants during the days of wooden sailing ships. It is meant to convey our status as entrepreneurs intent on pursuing profit even in the midst of conflict.<br><br>

<b>"Merchants"</b> - We pursue profit and experience through the manufacture, delivery, and sale of commodities and equipment as well as the search, retrieval, and sale of pre-collapse technology.<br><br>

<b>"Miners"</b> - Manufacturing requires base-resources, which presents us with another opportunity to profit; through the surveying and mining of mineral-rich asteroids.<br><br>

<b>"Mercenaries"</b> - Armed-conflict is not without its potential for profit. As-such, we intend to engage in combat when doing so is profitable or necessary for the defense of our profitability. We will attack the Conflux menace, as TRI provides compensation for their destruction and as their destructive-nature stands in the way of our profits. In like manner stand criminal enemies of the factions and TRI.</FONT></TD>

		<TD BGCOLOR='000000'><FONT COLOR='d2d2d2'><b>Military Duty</b><br>
As factions require a military presence in space, we often enlist for tours of duty with factional military forces. We do this because such tours of duty can be profitable both in terms of credit payments for mission-completion as well as in vital combat-experience. However, as our squad is, multi-factional, we do not collaborate to the benefit of any one faction.<br><br>

<b>Mercenary Contracts</b><br>
As combat-experienced members become available, we intend to make our services available for hire as escort pilots and wingmen. As it would be in conflict with out pro-TRI position, we will, however, reject any contract offers which would make targets of law-abiding civilian pilots.<br><br>

<b>Hacked Registries or so-called "Pirate" tags</b><br>
While the TRI Privateers are a loosely-organized band of profiteers, we do <b>NOT</b> prey upon civilian pilots. There is, however, legitimate usage for so-called "pirate" tags. Presently these tags are the only way to engage military forces (regardless of faction) without incurring steep bounties. As such, TRI Privateers are permitted to "hack" their registry if they wish to participate in multifactional combat operations (i.e. working for a factional force that is not your own).<br><br>

<b>TRI Civilian Registry</b><br>
Civilian tags should clearly-indicate your intentions to remain non-confrontational, so while flying with civilian tags please <b>do not</b>:</br><br> 

1. <b>Tune beacons in opposing faction space.</b><br> 
2. <b>Spy on, follow, report, or otherwise involve yourself with PvP operations.</b><br> 
3. <b>Intentionally "dump" flux on other pilots</b> - I understand that your own survival may require you to dump flux, but whenever possible ensure that any pilots in your sector are willing and able to handle your spawn before leaving.<br> 
4. <b>"Strip" stations</b> - Beyond what is necessary for the equipping of your own ship, do not remove supplies/equipment from stations that do not produce it.<br>
Easy-to-follow rule: If the factional color icon of the item is not the faction of the station where you are located, don`t haul it.<br> 
5. <b>Hunt or attack other pilots</b> - Obviously you, as a civilian, should not be attacking other civilians, and for bounty-reason you should not be attacking military pilots, but...<br> I would also ask that you avoid engaging pirates or bountied pilots except in defense. The game`s mechanics allow you to do so, but when you as a civilian attack a pirate, it puts that pilot in a no-win situation. They have no way of defending themselves against you without suffering greater penalties. So please - if you wish to hunt a pirate or bountied-pilot, please either fly with military or pirate tags yourself.<br><br>

General rule of thumb: <b>As a "civilian", you should never try to get another pilot killed.</b><br><br>

<b>Disclaimer:</b> "Criminal" pilots who do not maintain a coherent and/or resonable role-play justification for their hostilities may not be given this courtesy.<br><br>

<b>Hostilities</b><br>
Our squad desires to stand in defense of the weak and oppressed and we of-course stand in defense of each other. Some pilots and squads, on the other-hand, have oppressed the weak and attacked our pilots and as-such must be "dealt" with. Any pilots or squads which participate in the destruction of civilian vessels within regulated space thereby acquiring factional bounties are to be considered hostile. However some pilots/squads are priority-targets as the nature of their offenses are of personal-interest to our squad.<br></FONT></TD>
