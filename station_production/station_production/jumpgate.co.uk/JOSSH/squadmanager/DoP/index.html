		<TD BGCOLOR='D7D7DB'><FONT COLOR='050505'>1) The Mission Comes First <br>

DoP pilots do not abandon the mission for any reason.  Pilots flying escort will do everything they can to protect the client, even scuttle their own ship if necessary.  Pilots that abandon a client or abort a mission will be disciplined or removed from the Squadron. <br>
<br>
2) Respect the local political climate <br> DoP is apolitical, we have no say or opinion on relationships between the factions or the rivalries of other squads.  No DoP pilot will engage another pilot unless necessary in the defense of the mission, to complete the mission, or in defense of self.  DoP pilots will respect the rules of the factions wherever possible, unless those rules prevent the successful conclusion of the mission. 
<br>
<br>
3) The squad is mother, the squad is father <br>
DoP pilots respect and watch over each other.  If you find yourself in trouble call out of the squad channel and all available DoP pilots will respond.  Any DoP pilot found able but unwilling to come to the aid of another DoP pilot will be summarily removed from squadron.
<br>
<br>
4) Civillians are offlimits <br>
No DoP pilot may fire on a civilian unless that civilian is currently engaging a DoP pilot or the client.
<br>
<br>
5) Ask for nothing that you haven`t earned or don`t need. <br>
No DoP pilot will ask for brokered equipment unless it is absolutely necessary for the completion of the DoP assigned mission.  We are professionals and should be able to work unfettered by the equipment at our disposal.
<br>
<br> 
6) All participating DoP pilots will be compensated upon final mission payment. <br>
All DoP pilots participating in a DoP mission will be compensated Equally upon the receipt of final payment from the client.  10% of the total payment will be allocated towards bonuses to be awarded by the mission commander to those pilots that went above and beyond the call of duty in completion of the mission.  The dispensation of this bonus fund is up to the mission commander.
Fees obtained from missions contracted and fulfilled by a solo DoP pilot are not subject to this division.
<br>
<br> 
7) Be Professional. <br>

No DoP pilot will engage in any behavior seen as unprofessional.  So called "smack talk" is acceptable and an understandable part of what we do as pilots, but griefing, unprovoked non-gray beacon tuning, and other such behavior will result in removal of the offending pilot`s DoP Tag.
<br>
<br>
8) Lead by example <br>
DoP pilots will, at all times, do their best to set a prime example for other squads and pilots new to TRI.  If a DoP pilot can render aid to someone in distress without endangering himself or a DoP mission then aid should be rendered.  Any pilot creating a negative impression of the DoP by their actions will be removed from the squad immediately.
<br>
<br>
9) Teach the young, learn from the experienced. <br>

DoP pilots are encouraged to mentor new TRI pilots whenever possible in order to instruct them as well as keep them safe as they perform their duties.  Young DoP pilots are encouraged to find a mentor, preferably within DoP as all veteran DoP pilots will be available, to learn proper conduct and flight operations as quickly as possible.
<br>
<br>
10) Combat Pilots maintain the highest standards. <br>

DoP combat pilots, those pilots that are currently flying honor guarded, are required to uphold the ideals of TRI and DoP at all times.  Bountied pilots seen in regulated space should be queried and engaged if the circumstances indicate malicious behavior on their part.
Combat pilots that can flip beacons back to the color of the faction`s space it resides within should do so in regulated space whenever the opportunity arises in order to alleviate the political ramifications of a beacon flipping incursion perpetrated by those less scrupulous. 
Hyperial and Amananth fall currently under the category of `protectorate` in the eyes of DoP and therefore are endorsed as areas for extended beacon tuning.
<br>
<br>
11) Conduct yourself politely
<br>
DoP pilots are encouraged, unless the current mission prevents it, to announce themselves to the sector at wide in regulated space, ask to engage flux or announce that you are engaging flux currently targeting you. Pilots should be wary at docking collars and yield to heavy tows requesting right of way.
It is sometimes helpful to advertise your services while announcing your presence on the local channel.
<br>
<br>
12) Rates
<br>
Rates are determined by the DoP agent contracted and are directly related to:<br>
Length of journey<br>
Difficulty of journey<br>
Necessary disposal of Conflux<br> 
Price of commodity/Items couriered<br> (in the case of Delivery runs)<br>
Prices should be fair and competitive. Barter is allowable for solo contracted missions only unless previously negotiated with all DoP agents involved.</FONT></TD>
