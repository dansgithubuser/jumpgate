	<TD BGCOLOR="#222222">In order to further the expansion of the five systems, TRI has now made it possible for pilots to begin their own inter-faction and intra-faction squads. At this time there are no restrictions on founding a squad and no fees associated with this action. The only requirements are that you be a registered TRI pilot with an authorized name and password. You may not found a new squad without pilot accreditation.</TD>

In order to access the management system, you must enter the squad name, the user name of the squad founder, and the founder's password. The squad manager allows the founder to change up to 3 news stories, define 10 ranks within the squad, promote and demote members within this ladder, as well as adding and removing squad members. There is also a customizable color system that allows the founder to associate particular colors with his or her squad.</TD>

	<TD BGCOLOR="#222222">There are few rules to squad membership. Firstly, no pilot can be a member of more than one squad at a time. Pilots may switch squads as often as they wish, or be removed from all squads altogether.  Currently, there is a time delay associated with squad removal. However,  upon requesting removal, a pilot may apply for membership in another squad immediately.</TD>
