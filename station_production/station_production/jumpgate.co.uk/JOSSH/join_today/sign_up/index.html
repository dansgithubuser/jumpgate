<!--If you have an official retail boxed version of Jumpgate, you can use the CD Key to enable a 30 day free trial.  This is a 12 digit number found inside the box, usually on the CD jewel case.  A CD Key may be used only once, and is non-transferable.<BR>

After your trial period, continuing your subscription to Jumpgate is only US$9.95 a month by credit card.

<!--<P ALIGN="left">Once you have registered, pilots wishing to contribute further to the Reconstruction have the option of joining the Commissioned Pilot Service.  For a one-time fee of US$19.95, a Commission gives you the rank, credits, and political rating to climb into the cockpit of your faction's fighter-class vessel, allowing you to leap immediately into a more active role in squad warfare, space trading, and flux-hunting.  Use the Pilot Commissions link in the JOSSH menu or click <A HREF="http://www.themis-group.com/jumpgate/commission.phtml" TARGET="_top">here</A>.

<!--<FONT SIZE="-2">NOTE: During the registration process, you may receive warnings from your web browser about accepting a certificate from a non-trusted site.  This is due to the fact that NetDevil issues its own security certificates for SSL, and does not use a 3rd party Certificate Authority.  NetDevil uses SSL for password collection only, so you may safely accept the certificate to allow secure communications.  The payment service provider you choose will provide a separate and secure SSL connection for payment information.</FONT><BR>
