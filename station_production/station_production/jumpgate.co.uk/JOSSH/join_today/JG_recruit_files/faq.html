				<h2>What is Jumpgate?</h2>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Jumpgate is a massively-multiplayer space simulation, modeled after the classic space exploration games. New recruits start off in a shuttle of their 
						faction, with enough equipment and currency to get you going - from that point on, you make your own fortune and reputation.</p>
					<p>Other space MMOGs on the market are "space adventure RPGs" with point-and-click gameplay. Jumpgate is a true spaceflight simulator that 
						requires actual pilot skill in docking, maneuvering, and combat.</p>
				</blockquote>
			  
				<a name="2"></a>
				<h2>Is there a free trial?</h2>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Yes, anyone signing up automatically starts out in a 14-day trial period.  If you do not subscribe before that period elapses, you will not be billed at all.</p>
				</blockquote>
				
				<a name="3"></a>
				<h2>What is the DANCER engine?</h2>
				<blockquote>
					<p>DANCER (<b>D</b>rag <b>A</b>nd <b>N</b>ear-true-physics <b>C</b>ombined to <b>E</b>ngineer <b>R</b>eality) is NetDevil's proprietary physics engine that makes 
						space flight in Jumpgate so interesting and fun. Using Newtonian physics, your ship will continue to travel in a straight line once you accellerate, 
						even if you rotate your vessel - this means you can be facing a completely different direction than you are moving.</p>
					<p>You might be familiar with physics like this in 2D games like Asteroids and SubSpace - feeling in full 3D space takes it to a whole new level.</p>
				</blockquote>
			  
				<a name="4"></a>
				<h2>What kinds of controllers are supported?</h2>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Jumpgate supports mouse and keyboard as well as joystick controllers.</p>
					<p>Flight in Jumpgate is completely under your control - there is no point-and-click autoflight. To get where you're going, you 
						need to point yourself in the right direction, and maintain a steady course.</p>
				</blockquote>
			  
				<a name="5"></a>
				<h2>Is there PvP? Are there PKs?</h2>
				<blockquote> 
					<p>Jumpgate has no hard restrictions on PvP, except for novice players. Once you've advanced to rank 9, you lose your new player protections,
						and become a potential target for other players.  However, at that rank, the Light Fighter ship class becomes available.  The Light Fighter is a
						capable combat ship and is actually enjoyed and preferred by many high-ranked players who have access to several other combat ship
						choices.  Low rank won't prevent you from getting right into the thick of the fight if you so choose.</p>
					<p>This doesn't mean that you have no protection though, or that you'll immediately be a target. You will still be flagged as a Civilian pilot, 
						letting other players know that you don't wish to engage in combat. Although other players can engage you anyway, TRI imposes harsh penalties 
						on those that enjoy hunting civilians, and other pilots love collecting the bounties.</p>
					<p>If you're more the aggressive type, there are a number of PvP options available. Most immediately, PvP duels and battles occur frequently in the 
						online Simulator, where players can practice against each other using any equipment they'd like, with no cost and no penalties. You can also decide 
						to take up the banner of your faction's military, which allows open combat with any other players who belong to a hostile faction.</p>
				</blockquote>
			  
				<a name="6"></a>
				<h2>What sort of non-combat activities are available?</h2>
				<blockquote>
					<p>While there is a lot of combat in Jumpgate, that's by no means the only avenue for advancement. Jumpgate has a dynamic economy, with goods constantly being 
						manufactured to replace those that are consumed. Creating these goods requires materials, and that's where the haulers and miners come in.</p>
					<p>Often, the materials a station needs to create equipment are not produced locally. In order to keep everything functioning, 
						traders are invaluable for hauling commodities - and of course they can make a nice profit on the way.</p>
					<p>In some cases, not only are the materials not produced by that station, they're just plain in short supply. By outfitting your ship as a miner and heading for the 
						asteroids, a player can gather a number of types of ore, which can then be refined into the raw materials needed to make equipment.</p>
					<p>There are also artifacts floating through space that can be gathered up, if you want to spend the time to look for them. While many of these items aren't 
						in the greatest of shape, you'll potentially turn up priceless items that just cannot be obtained anywhere else.</p>
				</blockquote>
			  
				<a name="7"></a>
				<h2>Can you play solo in Jumpgate?</h2>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Yes, though your success may depend on what you're doing. Any activity in Jumpgate, except for possibly defeating the most difficult AI ships, can be pursued alone.</p>
					<p>Space is a dangerous place though, so most pilots join up with one of the many player-created squads, or they create their own. There's a lot to be said for 
						being part of a team, especially one with the same goals and ideals. As a new player, this can be especially helpful - squads tend to have access to 
						resources far beyond what's available to an individual, and a little bit of training and equipment can go a long way.</p>
				</blockquote>
			  
				<a name="8"></a>
				<h2>How do player-stations work?</h2>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Any pilot can purchase a player-station core at a faction station.  Prices start at a reasonable level for 2-point stations, but increase to be quite expensive 
						for larger ones. After this core item is purchased, the station can be placed by using a command at the location for construction. Once built, a station cannot be 
						moved, but it can be upgraded.</p>
					<p>Each station has a number of slots available for module additions based on the number of points on the core - these modules can do a variety of things, 
						including repairing ships, rearming weapons, increasing storage, processing ore, or even allowing entire ships to be stored in a hangar. If you'd like, 
						you can configure your station to be a public shopping area, or a squad-only rearmament station, or just a private storage area.</p>
				</blockquote>
			  
				<a name="9"></a>
				<h2>How much does it cost to play Jumpgate? What types of payment do you accept?</h2>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Unlike many MMOG's, our game software is free, and includes a single-player offline simulator in order for you to test performance and compatibility on your 
						system. You can find links to the most recent game client downloads <a href="../index.html" target="_top">here</a>.</p>
					<p>Subscriptions are available for $9.95 monthly. Jumpgate accepts subscriptions using all major credit cards, as well as a number of alternative payment types 
						through the <a href="http://www.paybycash.com/jumpgate/index.php" target="_blank">PayByCash</a> service. PayByCash supports many payment
						options, including: Money Order, Check-by-FAX, Virtual Check (aka 'eCheck'), Auto-Debit (aka 'Direct Debit'), Bank Transfer (aka Wire Transfer or Electronic Funds Transfer), 
						PayPal, Certa-Pay, Western Union, hyperWallet hyperWALLET™, C2it, USPS, Yahoo PayDirect, Cyphermint, and TravelersExpress® MoneyGram®.</p>
					<p>Episode 2, Jumpgate's first expansion, was released to all current players via download in March 2003, as a part of their subscription. In "Attack of the Conflux," 
						the Jumpgate universe received a major overhaul with the addition of nine new ships, player-stations, piracy, and a new map of hostile alien space.</p>
				</blockquote>
			  
				<a name="10"></a>
				<h2>Is there a Mac or Linux client?</h2>
				<blockquote>
					<p>At this time, Jumpgate is only available on 32-bit Windows operating systems. In the future we hope to be able to port the game client to other platforms, 
						but at the moment we're focused on providing the best experience we can with our current client.</p>
				</blockquote>
			  
				<a name="11"></a>
				<h2>What are the system requirements?</h2>
				<blockquote>
					<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">
