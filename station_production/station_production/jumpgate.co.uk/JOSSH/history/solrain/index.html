<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Solrain's TRI wing is efficient in combat, trade, mining and all aspects of reconstruction efforts.  This results from their business philosophies in monopolizing several financial markets.  Often boasting superior size cargo bays, as well as highly developed shield design, the technical ability of the average Sorian pilot is not to be mocked.  The Solrain home world, rich in raw materials and fertile soil, has allowed this nation to advance economically and agriculturally.  Thanks to the typical Sorian's predator-like business practices, Solrain has the deepest pockets of any faction by far.  This is why no other faction pays as high a signing bonus to new pilots.  Primary resources within the system include agricultural products and soft materials, among them barium, gold, iron, etc.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
The civilians of this system are adept at the manufacturing process, and as such have access to many different types of technology.  The Sorian trading prowess is a result of their stranglehold monopolies on the agricultural markets and several trade routes more so then on their skill as negotiators.  Solrain values the deep space trade routes above all else, thus the existence of its "persuasive" defense wings.

Solrain society is based heavily on experience, as are most of the recognized formal societies.  Sorian pilots gain status in a plethora of ways.  Actions of brutal efficiency which maximize profits for either individual or nation are the best for gaining status as a promising Sorian pilot.

The Solrain System is located between Hyperial and Octavius, and consists of approximately 25 sectors. At present the Sorians have built 3 space stations - Solrain Core Station, Wake Station, and Cornea Station. These stations are located near the dominant planets of the Solrain System - Soria, Hellion, and Amanra.
