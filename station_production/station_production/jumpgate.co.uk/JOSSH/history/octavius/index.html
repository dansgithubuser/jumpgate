<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Octavius is known for its commonly mercenary attitudes, where blood is often thinner than water.  Other than genetics and bloodline, there is no unifying organization to Octavius as a whole.  This gives rise to all manner of inner-faction power struggles, as various squads and rogue gangs constantly scramble for some semblance of control.  The typical mindset of these groups is simply Might Makes Right.  Perhaps this is why the weapons coming from Octavius Core (the seat of the system) are rarely paralleled in effectiveness and low power consumption.  Ship speeds are slightly lower than other factions on average.  A few inter-faction equipment trades can make these vessels some of the most feared in the universe.  Civilian life is a constant battle for survival in Octavius.  This might shed some light to the large number of volunteers for the TRI funded branch, as well as the tendency of most Octavians to trust no one.

<P ALIGN="left">
Octavius is resource poor, often struggling through famines and food shortages.  This drives the Octavian involvement in The Reconstruction Initiative, as resources must constantly be transported from external sectors of space to feed a largely broken civilization.  Octavian pilots prefer to gain recognition for actions of personal glory and personal financial success.  This includes combat, mining, trading, and exploration, fitting in nicely with TRI's objectives.

<H1 ALIGN="RIGHT">Octavius System Overview</H1>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
The Octavius System is located between Solrain and Amananth, and consists of approximately 20 sectors. At present the Octavians have built 3 space stations - Octavius Core Station, Great Pillars Station, and Outpost Station. These stations are located near the dominant planets of the Octavius System - Ares Prime, Martius, and Cinatus.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Only since Octavius joined TRI has Ares Prime become the premier planet of the Octavian Empire. Previously, planetary in fighting, civil and faction wars prevented the emergence of dominance on any of the three planets. Yet even today the political climate remains unstable and Ares Prime only barely holds on to its status, mainly due to its superior weapons manufacturing plants.<br>
