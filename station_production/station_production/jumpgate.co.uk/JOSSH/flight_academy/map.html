	<P><EM>Welcome Pilot. I am <STRONG>Zhilaa Katdinal</STRONG>, Divisional Chief of the TRI Bureau of Stellar Cartography. I've heard you needed some help using your sector map, and I was hoping we could work out some sort of.... deal. You see, I helped design that system, so I can tell you everything you need to know about it. The thing is, we're a little light on sector information from The Gurge... </EM></P>
	<P>This documentation briefly reviews basic map usage and functions. The map can be accessed in flight by pressing 'm', or in station by pressing the button labeled 'map' in the upper right hand corner.</P>
	<P>Some pilots prefer to have a hard copy map on hand, just incase their in flight systems should fail. TRI's most current 2D map can be found under the "TRI Files" subheading of the <a href="index.html">flight academy</a>.</P>
