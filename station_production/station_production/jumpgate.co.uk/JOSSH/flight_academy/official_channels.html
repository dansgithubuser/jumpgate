The following list represents public chat booths and channels officially recognized by TRI.  Any communication submitted over these channels should be considered easily susceptible to interception.  Therefore, communication should cover only material of an insensitive, non-confidential matter.
</P>
<P>
Every official booth or channel has an offical purpose.  Pilots are mandated to use these channels only for their intended purpose.  If a pilot is found to be misusing an official channel, they will be kicked from the system.  Misuse is determined at TRI's sole discretion.

To join one of these booths, type:<BR>
