	<P><EM>Greetings, pilot. This is <STRONG><B>Dorakk Thol</B></STRONG>, sectional chief of the TRI Bureau of Trade Regulation. TRI has noticed that your TRI credit account has been steadily growing, and I think it's important that you learn how to use the market interface in case you would like to begin spending.</EM></P>
	<p>TRI and their various partners offer a huge selection of wonderful toys for every pilot. These are available for purchase at the market. Every single item found here cannot only be applied for personal use, but can also sold for a tidy profit.</p>

<P>The basic market interface can be used to perform two basic tasks - purchasing and selling. The left portion of the screen displays the station's inventory, and the right portion displays your inventory. You will notice that the station inventory section has a list of equipment types - this portion of the market display is used to simplify item browsing at a station, due to the large amount of items that are kept in stock. (To the left of each sub-category you will notice an icon. these are useful symbols to know, as each item will always display this icon for easy reference.)</P>

<P>Along the top of the market inventory list you will notice several small boxes - these are sort options. The market inventory can be sorted in several ways:</P>

Each time your shields take damage they loose some of their power and then slowly recharge. Once shields are depleted your hull will take direct damage.

	<P><a HREF="../database/guns/index.html">Guns</a>seem to be the favored piece of equipment for some reason. These weapons are either energy or projectile based, or a combination their of. All energy weapons must be recharged by your power plant before they can be fired again. Their power diminishes over distance and eventually dissipates completely. On the other hand, projectile-based weapons do not require much energy and may be fired continuously, but they have a limited number of projectiles and generally do less damage. These guns will be automatically re-loaded upon docking with a friendly station. Ammo-based weapons require you to lead your target, i.e. you have to aim where your target will be at the time of impact. To aid you with this technique you can supplement these weapons with a targeting computer (available in the MODx section of the market).</P>
	<P>One special item that is listed among the guns is the mining laser. The mining laser represents a special sub-category of the weapons section. This device is mounted to a gun hard point and activated by pressing the fire button. Mining lasers extract ore from asteroids, which is then transported into you cargo hold. While a mining laser is not a weapon, its extractor beam will do a small amount of damage to a target.</P>
